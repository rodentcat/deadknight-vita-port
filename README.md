A port of Dead Knight: Pocket Edition for Vita !

After a while of experimenting and trying to figure out how the heck this was done https://github.com/m1s3ry/gato-roboto-vita ... I figured it out.
All credit goes to m1s3ry ! I may not know them personally, or at all really, but that repository let me know this was possible and gave me a slight idea on how to do it.

And to test this out, I wanted to port just some random game I had lying around on my hard drive... This one actually https://backterria.itch.io/dead-knight-pocket-edition

So, what you'll wanna do is... Download DeadKnightPatcher.zip and DeadKnight.vpk. Install the VPK first on your Vita, and then use the patcher. How, you may ask ?



PATCHER INSTRUCTIONS

STEP 1 !!!

Download the patcher.

STEP 2 !!!!

Download Dead Knight Pocket Edition from the itch.io link, and rename "Dead Knight - Pocket Edition.exe" to "DEAD.exe", without quotes.
Put it in the folder you extracted the patcher into !

STEP 3 !!!!!!

Run MakeTheIdiotDoTheThing.bat. I don't know what exactly posessed me to name it that, but it is what it is.

STEP 4 !!!!!!!!!!!!

Put the contents -- NOT THE FOLDER ITSELF, ONLY THE CONTENTS OF IT -- into /app/DEADKNI01/games on your Vita. I should also mention that it says that once you finish the .bat file too.

step 5 :)

You did it :D



So uh, yeah. Local idiot Elizabeth Sunner learns how nonsense works.
